# ModelBuilding

A collection of machine learning models implemented from scratch using Python and NumPy, without relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn.  
This repository is intended for educational purposes and aims to deepen understanding of how models work internally.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

Each folder contains a different model implementation with code and explanations.

### ðŸ”§ Models (to be added)
- [x] Linear Regression
- [x] Multiple Linear Regression
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [x] Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- [ ] Decision Tree
- [ ] k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
- [ ] Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- [ ] Neural Networks (Basic)

## ðŸ§  Goal

To understand the working principles of machine learning algorithms by:
- Implementing each from scratch.
- Avoiding black-box libraries.
- Focusing on core math and code.

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

- Python 
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib 

## ðŸš€ How to Use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SwarupD21/ModelBuilding.git
cd ModelBuilding/LinearRegression
python linear_regression.py
